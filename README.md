# project_euler
Repository containing code to answer projecteuler.net problems. Project Euler problems are a series of mathematical/computational programming problems.

The problems range in difficulty from 5-100% (100 % being the most difficult and 5% the least) in discretised levels (5:5:100). As such, folders containnig code to answer the problems will be titled according to their percentage difficulty. 

There are a total of 806 problems. 

Any coding language is welcomed - this is just for fun and a bit of coding warming up :)
